AI-Powered Phone Price Prediction Model
Pricing a phone is a critical and complex decision for both businesses and consumers. With numerous phone models launching every year at a rapid pace, retailers, shop owners, and businesses must decide whether to continue stocking certain models. Meanwhile, consumers rely on phone prices to assess a model's market performance and determine whether it's the right purchase.

However, phone pricing cannot be determined based on historical data alone—it is influenced by multiple macroeconomic factors, including:

Inflation Rate – Higher inflation increases production costs, leading to price hikes.
GDP Growth – Strong GDP boosts consumer purchasing power, increasing demand for premium phones.
Public Sentiment – Market perception and brand reputation directly impact pricing.
Supply Chain Disruptions – Component shortages or geopolitical factors can lead to price fluctuations.
Exchange Rates & Import Duties – Variations in currency exchange rates affect international pricing.
