# 📱 AI-Powered Phone Price Prediction Model

## 🚀 Overview  
Pricing a phone is a critical and complex decision for businesses and consumers. With new phone models launching rapidly, retailers must decide which models to stock, while consumers rely on pricing trends to make informed purchasing decisions.  

However, phone pricing is influenced by multiple macroeconomic factors beyond historical data, including:  

- **Inflation Rate** – Higher inflation increases production costs, leading to price hikes.  
- **GDP Growth** – Strong GDP boosts consumer purchasing power, increasing demand for premium phones.  
- **Public Sentiment** – Market perception and brand reputation directly impact pricing.  
- **Supply Chain Disruptions** – Component shortages or geopolitical factors can lead to price fluctuations.  
- **Exchange Rates & Import Duties** – Variations in currency exchange rates affect international pricing.  

## 🔍 Our Solution: AI-Powered Price Prediction  
We developed a **predictive AI model** that integrates **macroeconomic indicators** and **historical phone pricing trends** to accurately forecast future prices.

### 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Ensemble Model (Gradient Boosting + LSTM)**: Captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term pricing trends.  
✅ **Macroeconomic Analysis**: Incorporates external factors affecting phone prices.  
✅ **Historical Data Integration**: Learns from past pricing patterns for more reliable forecasts.  
✅ **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web application for real-time price predictions and visualizations.  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Data Ingestion** – Collects phone price trends and macroeconomic indicators.  
2️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Processes historical price movements, inflation rates, GDP trends, and supply chain disruptions.  
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Uses an ensemble of **Gradient Boosting and LSTM models** to predict future prices.  
4️⃣ **Prediction & Visualization** – Displays insights via an **interactive Streamlit UI** for retailers and consumers.
